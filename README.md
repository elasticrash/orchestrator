# Orchestration

This is a basic orchestration library written in Rust and still under development, so any use case with outcome not being f32 will probably not work

* You define an orchestration function by using `state_function!` macro

i.e.

``` rust
 let fn1: fn(State<f32, Error>) -> Result<State<f32, Error>, Error> =
        state_function!(pow2, f32, Error);
```

A state is defined as follows

``` rust
pub struct State<T, E> {
    pub proceed: bool,
    pub outcome: Result<T, E>,
    pub stage: Vec<bool>,
}
```

You can use the orchestration directly by using

``` rust
  let result = vec![fn1, fn2, fn3]
        .execute(State {
            proceed: true,
            outcome: Ok(6.),
            stage: Vec::<bool>::new(),
        });
```

Or by using the registration trait and assigning string names to the orchestration functions.
Which can be useful when you want to pass function sequences by configuration

``` rust
    registry.register(fn1, "pow2".to_string());
    registry.register(fn2, "pow3".to_string());
    registry.register(fn3, "sqrt".to_string());

        let result = vec!["pow2", "pow3", "sqrt"]
        .create(&registry.di_ref)
        .execute(State {
            proceed: true,
            outcome: Ok(6.),
            stage: Vec::<bool>::new(),
        });
```

Assigning values to the stage i.e.

```rust
            stage: vec![true, true, false, false],
``` 

allows you to bypass certain steps (marked as true, in the sequence)
